# DrugUseDetector
Unused medicines are the most usual thing found in every household mainly old people. Most of these medicines get discarded even though they are reusable. The primary reason for this problem is lack of awareness about the uses of that particular medication. If one gets to know the use of the drug the problem of drug wastage can be solved to an extent in the society.

The solution for this problem is to make people upload the picture of medicine strip and Later we can apply technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect and analyse the  drug information and search for the usage of extracted drug in a database and later transform the use of drug into the language of choice from the available languages.
